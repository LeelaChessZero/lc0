Lc0

Lc0 is a UCI-compliant chess engine designed to play chess via
neural network, specifically those of the LeelaChessZero project
(https://lczero.org).

To run this version you will also need several dll files from NVIDA's
CUDA, cuDNN and TensorRT. Those dlls can either be on the path from
an existing (or new) installation, or can be in the Lc0 folder.
Either way, you will get an error message for any that isn't found.

The dlls needed are the following:

1. CUDA
* cublas64_12.dll
* cublasLt64_12.dll
* cudart64_12.dll
* cufft64_11.dll

2. cuDNN
* cudnn64_9.dll
* cudnn_graph64_9.dll

3. TensorRT:
* nvinfer_10.dll
* nvinfer_builder_resource_10.dll
* nvinfer_plugin_10.dll
* nvonnxparser_10.dll
