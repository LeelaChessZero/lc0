Lc0

Lc0 is a UCI-compliant chess engine designed to play chess via
neural network, specifically those of the LeelaChessZero project
(https://lczero.org).

To run this version you will most likely need a very recent DirectML dll,
which you can get by running the included `install.cmd` script. Alternatively,
you can download the currently latest nuget installer package from
<https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Microsoft.AI.DirectML/1.15.4>.
If you don't know how to use nuget installer packages, you can change the
extension to .zip and open it as a normal zip file, the dll you need is
`/bin/x64-win/DirectML.dll`.
