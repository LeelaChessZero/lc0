# Tested with Android NDK r27c, default toolchain
# Targeting API level 21

# When targeting API levels < 24 the build fails unless _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is unset.
# Meson passes _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 but recent NDK toolchains have issues building
# for 32-bit ABIs when such macro it set. Relevant links:
#  https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/docs/32-bit-abi.md
#  https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/2996#issuecomment-384045808

# Set the toolchain path on your environment
# export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/android-sdk/ndk-bundle/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH"
